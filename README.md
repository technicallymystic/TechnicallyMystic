## The Short Version

👩‍💻 I’m a software engineer who started meditating in 2022 to fix my burnout.

🧘‍♀️ I was looking for stress relief.

🤯 Instead, I accidentally dismantled my entire worldview.

📖 Now I'm writing field notes from the messy middle.

## The Long Version

For a decade, I’ve built systems, debugged code, and lived by logic. I am a Virgo Sun, a Senior Engineer, and a skeptic by trade.

But 3.5 years ago, the stress of the tech industry broke me. I turned to meditation as a survival mechanism. I expected better sleep and focus.

What I got was a complete system override.

I went from an agnostic workaholic to a “mad mystic” writing poetry to the Divine at 2 AM.

I went from seeking stress relief to navigating the “Dark Night of the Soul” while trying to act normal in morning stand-ups and in my marriage. I spent years thinking I was living a double life—torn between the person everyone knew and the heart beating under the floorboards.

Now I'm working on the documentation of that dismantling. I'm creating, publishing, sharing, and archiving logs of an atheist turning into a mystic who's still trying to keep their day job.
