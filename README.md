### 👋 Hi there

I am a Senior Software Engineer who started meditating in 2022 for stress relief.

**Instead, I accidentally triggered a complete system override.**

### 🌗 The Double Life
I spent years feeling torn between the person everyone knew and the heart beating under the floorboards.

Now, I document the integration.

### 🧭 Navigation by Depth
My documentation is organized by "Levels" of intensity, for the skeptic and the seeker alike:

* **[Level 0: Technical](https://technicallymystic.com/s/level-0-technical)** — Burnout, stress, and the rational analysis of "woo."
* **[Level 1: Transitional](https://technicallymystic.com/s/level-1-transitional)** — When the worldview cracks and the double life begins.
* **[Level 2: Mystical](https://technicallymystic.com/s/level-2-mystical)** — Longing, devotion, and the "Dark Night."
* **[Level 3: Union](https://technicallymystic.com/s/level-3-union)** — *Space Division.* Direct experience and the dissolution of self.
